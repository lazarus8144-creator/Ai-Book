## How to Use the Chatbot

### Opening the Chatbot
1. Look for the **floating chat icon** in the bottom-right corner of any page
2. Click the icon to open the chat interface
3. Type your question in the text box and press Enter or click Send

### Asking Effective Questions

**Good Questions:**
- "What is the difference between forward and inverse kinematics?"
- "How do I implement a PID controller for a robotic arm?"
- "Explain the D-H parameters for a 6-DOF manipulator"
- "What are the key components of ROS 2?"
- "Can you summarize the chapter on motion planning?"

**Tips for Better Answers:**
- Be specific about what you want to know
- Ask one question at a time for clearer responses
- If the answer isn't clear, ask follow-up questions
- Reference specific chapters or topics when relevant

### Example Conversations

**Example 1: Concept Clarification**
```
You: What is forward kinematics?
Chatbot: Forward kinematics is the process of calculating the position
and orientation of a robot's end-effector given the joint angles...

You: Can you give me an example?
Chatbot: Certainly! For a 2-link planar arm, if joint 1 is at 30°
and joint 2 is at 45°...
```

**Example 2: Implementation Help**
```
You: How do I create a ROS 2 publisher in Python?
Chatbot: To create a ROS 2 publisher in Python, follow these steps:
1. Import necessary modules...
2. Create a node class...
[Provides code example from textbook]
```

## What the Chatbot Can Help With

### ✅ The Chatbot CAN:
- Answer questions about robotics concepts covered in the textbook
- Explain technical terms and definitions
- Provide code examples from the textbook
- Summarize chapters or sections
- Clarify complex topics with examples
- Help you understand mathematical formulas and algorithms
- Guide you through implementation steps
- Compare different approaches or techniques
- Answer questions about ROS 2, kinematics, dynamics, control systems, and all textbook topics

### ❌ The Chatbot CANNOT:
- Debug your specific code errors (it doesn't have access to your code)
- Grade your assignments or projects
- Provide information not covered in the textbook
- Write complete project code for you
- Access external websites or resources
- Remember conversations from previous sessions (unless you're logged in)
- Provide real-time information about software updates

## Technical Details

### How It Works
1. **Your Question**: You type a question in the chat interface
2. **Information Retrieval**: The system searches the textbook database for relevant content
3. **AI Processing**: OpenAI's GPT model processes the retrieved information and your question
4. **Response Generation**: The AI generates a comprehensive answer based on textbook content
5. **Display**: You receive a formatted response with references

### Privacy & Data
- Your chat conversations are processed to provide answers
- If you're logged in, conversations may be saved to personalize your experience
- All data is handled securely and not shared with third parties
- The chatbot only has access to textbook content, not your personal information

### Powered By
- **OpenAI GPT-4** for natural language understanding and generation
- **Qdrant Vector Database** for fast semantic search
- **FastAPI Backend** for efficient processing
- **React Frontend** for smooth user interface

## Authentication Features

If you create an account and log in, you get additional benefits:

### Enhanced Features for Logged-In Users
- **Personalized Responses**: Answers adapted to your skill level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- **Learning History**: Track which topics you've asked about
- **Conversation Continuity**: Pick up where you left off in previous sessions
- **Progress Tracking**: See your learning journey over time
- **Saved Conversations**: Access your chat history anytime

### Your Learning Profile
When you sign up, you can set:
- **Skill Level**: Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced
- **Learning Goals**: What you want to achieve
- **Prior Experience**: Your background in robotics

The chatbot uses this information to tailor explanations to your level!

## Getting Started

### First-Time Users
1. **Explore**: Click the chat icon and ask a simple question like "What topics does this textbook cover?"
2. **Learn**: Browse through different chapters and use the chatbot to clarify concepts
3. **Practice**: Ask about implementation details as you work through examples
4. **Deepen**: Use the chatbot to explore advanced topics at your own pace

### Best Practices
- Start with broader questions, then get more specific
- Use the chatbot alongside reading the textbook, not as a replacement
- Experiment with different ways of asking the same question
- Ask for examples when concepts are unclear
- Request summaries of long chapters to get an overview first

## Troubleshooting

### Chatbot Not Responding?
- Check that the chat window is fully loaded
- Ensure you have an internet connection
- Try refreshing the page
