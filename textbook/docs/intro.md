# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive course on building intelligent humanoid robots. This textbook covers the complete journey from robotic communication systems to AI-powered decision making.

## Course Overview

This course provides hands-on experience with the four foundational pillars of modern humanoid robotics:

### Course Modules

1. **[Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/module-1-ros2)** - Learn the communication backbone that connects all robotic components
2. **[Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)](/module-2-digital-twin)** - Simulate and test before deploying to physical hardware
3. **[Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)](/module-3-nvidia-isaac)** - Add intelligence and perception capabilities
4. **[Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](/module-4-vla)** - Enable natural human-robot interaction

## Learning Path

Each module builds upon the previous one, creating a complete understanding of humanoid robotics.

## Prerequisites

- **Programming**: Basic Python knowledge (intermediate Python recommended)
- **Mathematics**: Linear algebra fundamentals, basic calculus
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 or similar Linux distribution
- **Hardware**: See [Hardware Overview](/hardware-overview) for detailed requirements

## Course Structure

Each module contains:

- **Learning Objectives**: Clear goals for what you'll master
- **Concept Explanations**: Theory and background information
- **Code Examples**: Runnable examples with syntax highlighting
- **Hands-On Labs**: Practical exercises to reinforce learning
- **Assessment**: Self-check questions and projects

## Getting Started

1. Review the [Hardware Overview](/hardware-overview) to ensure you have the necessary equipment
2. Start with [Module 1: ROS 2](/module-1-ros2) to learn the robotic nervous system
3. Work through each module sequentially for best results
4. Practice with the provided code examples and exercises
