## What is a Digital Twin?

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical system that mirrors its behavior and characteristics.

## Benefits for Robotics

- **Safe Testing**: Test dangerous scenarios without risk
- **Cost Effective**: Iterate designs without physical prototypes
- **Rapid Development**: Parallel development with hardware
- **Validation**: Verify algorithms before deployment

## Simulation Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Strengths |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Gazebo | Physics simulation | Accurate dynamics, ROS 2 integration |
| Unity | Photorealistic rendering | Visual quality, game engine features |

## Summary

- Digital twins accelerate robot development
- Simulation complements physical testing
- Multiple tools serve different purposes
